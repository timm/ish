# A  Toolbox of Useful (ish) LISP Functions

## Install

      git clone http://github.com/timm/ish

To test this all works, then

      cd ish/src
      clisp tests

## Files

Each file `X.lisp` knows its own dependancies so can be loaded seperately
to all the rest. E.g. (in clisp):

      cd src
      clisp X

Most files `X.lisp` comes with a  little executable tutorial on
how to use it in `Xok.lisp`.

Most of the code in these  tutorial are `deftest`s; i.e. unit tests
that check if the right thing is being generated by the functions.
To run  `X.lisp`'s  unit tests, just load its tutorial:

      cd src
      clisp Xok

To run all the unit tests, run:
  
      cd src
      clisp tests

This loads all the `*ok.lisp` files (in alphabetical order), then runs
all their tests.
That code outputs something like the following:

```
; stringok
; test
; string
; listok
; list
; testok
; macrook
; macro

;;; CHARS!
; seeking 3 characters

;;; FRED!
; seeking association list

;;; _AA
; should be one failure
; fail : expected 2

;;; DOITEMS!
; seeking association list

; pass : 4 =  80.0%
; fail : 1 =  20.0%
```

Note the last line-- the ISH test suite has one failure built (so we can test that the unit tests
can catch failing tests).
