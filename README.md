# A  Toolbox of Useful (ish) LISP Functions


Each file `X.lisp` knows its own dependancies so can be loaded seperately
to all the rest. E.g. (in clisp):

      cd src
      clisp X

Most files `X.lisp` comes with a  little executable tutorial on
how to use it in `Xok.lisp`.

Most of the code in these  tutorial are `deftest`s; i.e. unit tests
that check if the right thing is being generated by the functions.
To run  `X.lisp`'s  unit tests, just load its tutorial:

      cd src
      clisp Xok

To run all the unit tests, run:
  
      cd src
      clisp tests

This loads all the `*ok.lisp` files (in alphabetical order), then runs
all their tests.
That code outputs something like the following:

```
; stringok
; test
; string
; listok
; list
; testok
; macrook
; macro

;;; CHARS!
; seeking 3 characters

;;; FRED!
; seeking association list

;;; _AA
; should be one failure
; fail : expected 2

;;; DOITEMS!
; seeking association list

; pass : 4 =  80.0%
; fail : 1 =  20.0%
```

Note the last line-- the ISH test suite has one failure built (so we can test that the unit tests
can catch failing tests).

## Code files

To write a file for `ISH`, add the following two lines as a header:

      #-base (load "base")
      (uses "other" "files" "to" "load")

- The first line loads ISH's `base` code (if it has not already been loaded.
- The second line loads all other files, but again, only if they have 
not been loaded before.

## Unit test files

To write unit tests for `ISH` for file `X.lisp`,
create a file `Xok.lisp` whose first lines are:

      #-base (load "base")
      (uses
        "tests"
        "X" ; the code you want to test
      )

- In that file, write a function with the tests;
- Add `(test want got)` calls inside the function to check
  that the right tigns are being returned;
- Change the function's `defun` to `deftest`

Nest, at the last line of the `Xok.lisp`, add this line:

    (tests)

Enjoy!
