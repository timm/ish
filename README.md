# A  Toolbox of Useful(ish) LISP Functions


Each file `X.lisp` knows its own dependancies so can be loaded seperately
to all the rest. E.g. (in clisp):

      cd src
      clisp X

Most files `X.lisp` comes with a  little executable tutorial on
how to use it in `Xok.lisp`.

      cd src
      clisp Xok

Most of the code in the tutorial are `deftest`s; i.e. unit tests
that check if the right thing is being generated by the functions.
To run  `X.lisp`'s  unit tests, just load its tutorial:

      cd src
      clisp Xok

To run all the unit tests, run:
  
      cd src
      clisp tests

## Code files

To write a file for `ISH`, add the following two lines as a header:

      #-base (load "base")
      (uses "other" "files" "to" "load")

- The first line loads ISH's `base` code (if it has not already been loaded.
- The second line loads all other files, but again, only if they have 
not been loaded before.

## Unit test files

To write unit tests for `ISH` for file `X.lisp`,
create a file `Xok.lisp` whose first lines are:

      #-base (load "base")
      (uses
        "tests"
        "X" ; the code you want to test
      )

- In that file, write a function with the tests;
- Add `(test want got)` calls inside the function to check
  that the right tigns are being returned;
- Change the function's `defun` to `deftest`

Nest, at the last line of the `Xok.lisp`, add this line:

    (tests)

Enjoy!
