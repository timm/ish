I have spent too much of my life configuration new machines
to run old code.
No more. Here in this repo is code that can be downloaded and executed 
straight "out of the box" (by a LISP interpreter) on Mac or on a \*nix platform.
No bash aliases. No shell variables. No initialization of a package management system.
No config files written outside of these directories. No ``just install these 17 packages
inside the code editor''. Just install your LISP (e.g. clisp), download this code, and go. 

So please enjoy tinkering with
all my useful (ish)  LISP tricks.
And if you don't
like what you see, kill it all with no side-effects using `rm -rf ish`.


Note: this code has been tested
on CLISP <img align=middle src="https://clisp.sourceforge.io/clisp.png" height=30>
and  SBCL <img  align=middle src="http://www.sbcl.org/sbclbutton.png" height=30>.
I need a tester for Allegro. Anyone?

## Install
<img align=right src="http://www.lisperati.com/lisplogo_warning_256.png">

### Step1: Install LISP

Install `clisp` or `sbcl`. E.g. on a Mac:

      brew install clisp

### Step2: Get Files  

#### Using`git clone`

      git clone http://github.com/timm/ish
      cd ish


#### Using a zip file


      wget https://github.com/timm/ish/archive/master.zip
      unzip master.zip
      cd ish-master

### Step3: Testing your installation


      cd src
      clisp tests
      # or
      sbcl --script tests.lisp

This should execute dozens of tests, one of which will fail (just to show that the test engine can catch failing tests).

## Tips

### Running Files

Each file `X.lisp` knows its own dependancies so can be loaded seperately
to all the rest. E.g. (in clisp):

      cd src
      clisp X
      # or
      sbcl --script X.lisp

Most files `X.lisp` comes with a  little executable tutorial on
how to use it in `Xok.lisp`.

Most of the code in these  tutorial are `deftest`s; i.e. unit tests
that check if the right thing is being generated by the functions.
To run  `X.lisp`'s  unit tests, just load its tutorial:

      cd src
      clisp Xok
      # or
      sbcl --script Xok.lisp

### Regression Suite

To run all the unit tests, run:
  
      cd src
      clisp tests
      # or
      sbcl --script tests.lisp

This loads all the `*ok.lisp` files (in alphabetical order), then runs
all their tests.
That code outputs something like the following:

```
; stringok
; test
; string
; listok
; list
; testok
; macrook
; macro

;;; CHARS!
; seeking 3 characters

;;; FRED!
; seeking association list

;;; _AA
; should be one failure
; fail : expected 2

;;; DOITEMS!
; seeking association list

; pass : 4 =  80.0%
; fail : 1 =  20.0%
```

Note the last line-- the ISH test suite contains one 
deliberate failure (so we can test that the unit tests
can catch failing tests).

### Editing

I've been collecting my favorite VIM configs for editing files
(in general) and editing LISP (in partciular). These can be access via:

      cd src
      vim -u ../.vim X.lisp

### Gitting

      git pull
      git commit -am "updating"; git push

Note that this distribution comes with a [.gitignore](.gitignore) that blocks
the usual temporaries from getting inappropriately added to git.

### Annoyances

This code was written to run in SBCL and CLISP. These implementations of LISP
go their own seperate ways on many things, including CLOS. When I just cannot resolve
their differing approaches, I do something to dodge the problem (e.g. go to `defstruct`
rather than `defclass`, or building my own simpler class system called `defthing`).
